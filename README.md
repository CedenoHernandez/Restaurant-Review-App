# Restaurant Review App
---
Completed as the final project for Udacity's FEND program. Starter code provided. I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application with accessibility and responsiveness. I also implement a service worker to allow users to experience the site offline first.

## Installation:
---
* Download the repository:
* Click download ZIP on the right of the screen, then extract the zip file to your computer, or clone the repository using git.
* Navigate to where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository with your shell command line.
* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`
* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
